# Delete

Delete an asset from Walbucket storage. This removes the asset from both the Sui blockchain and Walrus storage.

## Method Signature

```typescript
delete(assetId: string): Promise<void>
```

## Parameters

### `assetId` (required)

The asset ID to delete. This is the `assetId` returned from the `upload` method.

## Returns

`Promise<void>` - Resolves when the asset is successfully deleted.

## Examples

### Basic Delete

```typescript
await walbucket.delete(assetId);
console.log('Asset deleted successfully');
```

### Delete with Error Handling

```typescript
try {
  await walbucket.delete(assetId);
  console.log('Asset deleted successfully');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to delete asset:', error.message);
}
```

### Delete After Confirmation

```typescript
async function deleteAsset(assetId: string) {
  // Get asset info first
  const asset = await walbucket.getAsset(assetId);
  
  if (!asset) {
    console.log('Asset not found');
    return;
  }
  
  // Confirm deletion
  const confirmed = confirm(`Delete ${asset.name}?`);
  
  if (confirmed) {
    await walbucket.delete(assetId);
    console.log('Asset deleted');
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

The `delete` method may throw the following errors:

- `ValidationError` - Invalid API key, missing delete permissions, or asset not found
- `BlockchainError` - Failed to delete asset from Sui blockchain
- `NetworkError` - Failed to delete from Walrus storage

```typescript
try {
  await walbucket.delete(assetId);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
    console.error('Validation error:', error.message);
    // Check if API key has delete permission
  } else if (error instanceof BlockchainError) {
    console.error('Blockchain error:', error.message);
  } else if (error instanceof NetworkError) {
    console.error('Network error:', error.message);
  }
}
```

## Notes

- Deleting an asset removes it from both the Sui blockchain and Walrus storage
- This action **cannot be undone** - make sure you want to delete the asset
- You must have delete permissions on your API key
- The asset must exist and be owned by your developer account
- Cached metadata is automatically cleared
